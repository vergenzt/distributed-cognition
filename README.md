# Case Study in Distributed Cognition

This paper was a case study on distributed cognition for Georgia Tech's CS 3790 (Cognitive Science) course. The analysis is modeled after Edwin Hutchins' 1995 paper "[How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds](CockpitSpeeds.pdf)" (retrieved 7/6/2017 from [ucsd.edu](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~ehutchins/documents/CockpitSpeeds.pdf)).
